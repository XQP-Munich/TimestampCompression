# TimestampCompression
Analysis and implementation of data compression techniques for timestamps.

# Description

When applied to post-processing in quantum key distribution (QKD), compression reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the classical channel.
If the times of detection events are assumed to follow a Poisson process, compressing using the [Golomb-Rice](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=Golomb-Rice&ia=web) method works quite well.

The repository includes a fully self-contained [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook (using the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language), demonstrating the method and its performance in a satellite-QKD scenario. All plots and data are generated by the notebook and can be accessed in this repository.
